How to use Polygon Editor?

The application layout is divided into two parts:
	- the left one: a canvas
	- the right one: options menu
	
Right menu allows choosing one of three modes:

ADD POLYGON mode:
	- LMB adds a new vertex and opens a new polygon
	- Further clicking will add next vertices to the polygon
	- To finish drawing the polygon, click the starting vertex
	- To abandon an open polygon and delete it, press DEL key
	
EDIT POLYGON mode:
	- LMB and dragging moves vertices, edges or polygons on the canvas
	- RMB removes the vertex from polygon (removing a vertex from a triangle will delete the polygon)
	- Double click on any edge adds a new vertex in the middle
	
ADD CONSTRAINT mode:
	- LMB sets a fixed length for the edge (close the popup with X to abandon setting a constraint) - this is denoted by a number appearing next to the edge
	- RMB defines the set of parallel edges - this is denoted by a number in a green circle in the middle of the edge
		* edges with the same number will be parallel to each other
		* in order to add another edge to the exisiting parallel group, first right click the edge in the group and then right click the new edge
	
	"Remove constraints" button will clear all the length or parallelism relations set

In the right bottom corner of the application there is a menu that allows to choose an algorithm used to draw edges between vertices:
	- System algorithm implemented in C# as a method Graphics.DrawLine(Pen, Point, Point)
	- Manually implemented Bresenham algorithm

The change of the chosen algorithm will apply immediately.
